## PyTorch GAN Package General Information

This PyTorch GAN Package includes different GANS using PyTorch and Python programming. The purpose of this package is to give the developer community a useful that will help make and test specific kinds of GANs. The GANs in the package include:

* Simple GAN
* Wasserstein GAN
* Conditional GAN
* Controllable GAN

This package also includes a Super Trainer file, a ToTrain file, and visualizations. The package is designed so the user does not have to write a GAN entirely from scratch.

If the user has no expreience with GANs, some experience with Python and opaque Machine Learning, or a GAN expert, this tool will be beneficial.

The package design was built with three key features in mind: model building, model training, and model evaluation. For GAN structures that involve novel additions to previous designs, or require the manipulation of technical, subtle changes to the way training is conducted, the package can function as a tool kit for developers and researchers alike.
